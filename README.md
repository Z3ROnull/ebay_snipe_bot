# ebay_snipe_bot
It's been a while since I'm participating in ebay bids and I'm always beaten at the last second. Here I'm trying to make an ebay snipe bot to beat the other bots. I've read the ebay policy and this kind of bots are allowed. 

It still doesn't work, but fortunately with the help of the GitHub community it will. 
And it's going to stay here, free and opensource for everyone.
